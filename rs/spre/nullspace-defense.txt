* write down the formulation of null defense / duality network
* flatcat -- not universal l2 but individual l2
* duality -- only increase the cosine similarity. don't do MSE/euclidean alignment.

* [ok] knot loss -- only constraints the representation vector. don't limit the intermediate knots
  now it only aligns the representation vectors.
