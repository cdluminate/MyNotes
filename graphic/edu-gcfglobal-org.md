**Design speaks louder than words.**

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
# 1. Typography
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

typography is the style or apperance of text. (art of working with text)

## common types of fonts

serif font (traditional uses, like printed publications)

sans serif font (easier to read on screens)

display font (small amount of text -- titles headers etc)

less is more, use as less types of fonts as possible. differentiate them with size, weight, and style (italic, etc)

font combinations: sans serif + serif; short with tall; decorative with simple

## advanced topics

kerning, leading, tracking, hierarchy (essential for professional looking designs)

* hierarchy: guide the reader's eye to whatever is most important. where to begin, where next. First to read items can stand out (larger, bolder, or different someway)

* leading: space between lines of text (line spacing). (for comfortable to read.) default should be good

* tracking: overall space between characters (character space). dense / span. 

* kerning: space between specific characters. (varies across words)

# 2. Color (Color Theory)
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

from RGB to color wheel. 

* hue: just another word of color

* saturation: color intensity: subtle / vibrant

* value: how dark or light the color is. from black to white

https://color.adobe.com/ provides an easy to use color wheel with many color harmony rules.

## Color harmony

1. the easiest formula for harmony is monochromatic because it only uses one hue. The best thing about monochromatic schemes is that they are guaranteed to match. just tune saturation and value to find different variants.

2. analogous. use colors that are next to each other on the wheel.

3. complementary: colors opposite to each other.

4. split complementary. same level of contrast, but more colors to work with

5. triadic: three colors that are evenly spaced, forming a perfect triangle on the wheel. tend to be pretty striking.

6. tetradic. form a rectangle on the wheel, using not one but two complemeentary color pairs. works best if you let one color dominate while the others serve as an accent.

## Dos and Don'ts

1. colors that seem to vibrate when they are placed next to each other. solution: tone it down. start with one color, try adjust lightness, darkness, or saturation.

2. readability. sometimes that means not using colors. at least not in every detail. neutral colors like black, white and gray can help you balance your design. so when you do use color, it really stands out

3. message. bright colors tend to have a fun or modern vibe. desaturated colors often appear more business-like.

# 3. Layout and Composition
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

The are the foundation of design. structure. easier to navigate.

1. proximity. using visual space to show relationships in your content. in practice, related items are grouped together, e.g. blocks of texts, and elements in a grpahic. groups that are not related should be separated to show their lack of relationship

2. white space. helps you to define and separate different sections.

3. alignment. the most important thing is to be consistent.

4. contrast. catch the reader's eye, create emphasis, or call attention to something important. strategies: color, size, shape, visual weight, style of text.

5. repetition. consistent look and feel. for instance, if you have a specific color palette, look for ways to carry it through. if you have chosen a special header style, use it every time. apart from aethetic reasons, being consisent can also make your work easier to read.

# 4. Images
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

high quality images. stock. (materials for designers)

raster. vector.

1. cropping.

2. cosmetic (color adjust)

3. resizing.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
# 5. Fundamentals of Design
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

line, shape, form, texture, balance.

1. line. add emphasis, divide / organize content, guide viewer's eye. pay attention to weight, color, texture, style.

2. shape. geometric (regular) or organic (free form). organize / separate content, create simple illustrations, add interest to your work.

3. form. a shape that comes into 3d. makes realism possible. even flat designs use subtle techniques to hint at form and depth.

4. texture. physical quality of a surface. too much texture in a single design can quickly become overwhelming.

5. balance. the equal distribution of visual weight. color, size, number, negative space. symmetric / asymmetrical designs.

*rule of thirds*: imagine the work is divided by a 3x3 grid. the focal point on the image is placed near one of these lines, creating visual balance with rest of the space.


# 6. visual identity

main components: logo, color, typography, images.
