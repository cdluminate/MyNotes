# 1. Typography

typography is the style or apperance of text. (art of working with text)

## common types of fonts

serif font (traditional uses, like printed publications)

sans serif font (easier to read on screens)

display font (small amount of text -- titles headers etc)

less is more, use as less types of fonts as possible. differentiate them with size, weight, and style (italic, etc)

font combinations: sans serif + serif; short with tall; decorative with simple

## advanced topics

kerning, leading, tracking, hierarchy (essential for professional looking designs)

* hierarchy: guide the reader's eye to whatever is most important. where to begin, where next. First to read items can stand out (larger, bolder, or different someway)

* leading: space between lines of text (line spacing). (for comfortable to read.) default should be good

* tracking: overall space between characters (character space). dense / span. 

* kerning: space between specific characters. (varies across words)
