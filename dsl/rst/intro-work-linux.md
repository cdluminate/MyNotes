# Working with Linux

## Choice of Distributions

There are too many Linux distributions available, e.g. Archlinux, CentOS,
Debian, Deepin, ElementaryOS, Fedora, Gentoo, Kali, Mint, OpenSUSE, Red Hat,
Scientific Linux, Slackware, SteamOS, Ubuntu ...

* Demand

* Requirement

---

## Differences from that Popular OS

* System Calls

* Partitions and FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)

* GUI Dependency & Mouse Usage

* User-friendly?

* Package Management and Application Ecology.

* License

## Rescue Yourself

Assume that we get a good comprehension on the screen output.

* Manpages

* Help Information

* ArchWiki

* Google is the BEST (Don't use the popular search engine in the Chinese Mainland)

* Github

---

## Shell & Shell Scripting

* POSIX SHELL e.g. Bash

* Pipe

* Regular Expression

---

## Admin

* Quota, RAID, LVM, ZFS (Solaris)

* Filesystem Snapshot and Backup

* Services e.g. SSH

* Toolchain (assembler, C compiler, CXX compiler, Make, CMake, ...)

* CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN

---

## Python Package Management

* Anaconda

* Pip

---

## Caffe

A bit complicated.

## Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, etc.

Via pip or conda.

---

# Performance Tweaks

Profiling. CPU-Bound. IO-Bound. GEMM.

## CPU

OpenBLAS, MKL, Num of Threads.

## GPU

CPU -> CUDA

CUDA -> cuDNN

## IO

Cache

Tmpfs (Ramdisk)

## Programming Trick

C

CXX

Python
