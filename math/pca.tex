\subsection{Tucker Decomposition}

The Tucker decomposition family includes methods such as HOSVD (higher-order 
SVG) and HOOI (higher-order orthogonal iteration).

The $k$-mode product of a tensor $X\in R^{\cdots}$ with a matrix $A\in
R^{\cdots}$ is written as $Y=X\times_k A$. Then Tucker decomposition looks
like
$$
T_{n_1,n_2,n_3} \approx R_{r_1,r_2,r_3}
\times_1 A_{n_1,r_1} \times_2 B_{n_2,r_2} \times_3 C_{n_3,r_3}
$$
