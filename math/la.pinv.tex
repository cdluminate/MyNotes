Any matrix $A$ has its Penrose pseudo-inverse, which is denoted as $A^+$,
and satisfies the following $4$ Penrose equations:
$$ AXA=A, XAX=X, (AX)^H=AX, (XA)^H=XA$$

Existence by rank decomposition:
$$A = FG, F^+ = (F^HF)^{-1}F^H, G^+ = G^H(GG^H)^{-1}$$
$A^+=G^+F^+ = G^H(F^HAG^H)^{-1}F^H$ satisfies the 4 Penrose equations.

Existence by SVD factorization:
$$A = UDV^H = U\begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_r&O\\ O&O\end{bmatrix} V^H$$
$$A^+ = VDU^H = V\begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_r^{-1}&O\\ O&O\end{bmatrix} U^H$$

Uniqueness of penrose pseudo inverse: Assume $X$, $Y$ are two different
pseudo inverse of $A$, then we find that
$$ X = XAX = XAYAX = X(AY)^H(AX)^H = AA(AXAY)^H = X(AY)^H = XAY =
   XAYA = (XA)^H(YA)^HY = (YAXA)^HY = (YA)^HY = YAY = Y$$
which is contradict to the initial assumption.
