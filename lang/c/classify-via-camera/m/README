What to put on this dir?
========================

```
system ("classification m/deploy.prototxt m/bvlc_reference_caffenet.caffemodel m/imagenet_mean.binaryproto m/synset_words.txt Frame.jpg");
```
  
Note the above line, you need a `deploy.prototxt`, a trained `*.caffemodel`, a `mean.binaryproto`,
a `labels.txt`. The `picture.jpg` is not required when it is captured from camera.
