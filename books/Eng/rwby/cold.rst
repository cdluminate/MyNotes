i never felt that it was wise to wish too much

to dream to big would only lead to being crushed
         too

then I met you, you weren't afraid of anything

you told me how to leave the ground, to use my wings
    taught

i never thought a hero would ever come my way

but more than that, i never thought that you'd be taken away

now it's cold we felt you here
              without

it's like winter lasts for years
                       all year

but your soul's still live in the sky
         star's       ----

so i won't say goodbye

i don't have to say goodbye

my ? of doubt within the past with you around
   days       were in

you helped me feel a head of place direction found
                   I had a        ,

you should be there a greater dream can be achieved
    showed me that

in the free zone we'll conquer all if we believe
enough resolve will

i like you gave to guide me we'll never fade away
the light you gave to       will

but moving forward would never fail as hard as today
                   never felt

now it's cold we felt you here
              without

it's like winter lasts for years
                       all year

but your soul's still living in the sky
         star's       ------

so i won't say goodbye

i don't have to say goodbye
