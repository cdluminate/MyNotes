from shadows

we've already set apart from the world
we'll descend upon the world

take my quad you start
     back what you stole

from shadow

we've already play my destiny
we'll reclaim our destiny

set our future free

am i right
and we'll rise

am i right
and we'll rise

from burning dynas in the shade
above the darkness and the shame

but we'll toture in the pain
above the torture and the pain

above the ridiculous hate
above the riducule and hate

above the finding ??
above the binding of our fate

bored with no life
born

into subtigation
     subjugation

treated like a

worthless animal

shipped of alright
stripped of all rights

just thorugh like through being
just a lessert being

crushed by grown on
           crule

where glass you my brow
ruthless human rule

when it started

i will want it was chasing for life
all we wanted was a chance to live our lives

now in darkness

taking anything we wanted we are right
taking everything we want and we will rise

we are right
we'll rise

we are right
we'll rise
