never thought that you would stay forever

never asked you to commit your life

i can tell you in my heart a never
but                       I

all you don't believe in me
thought you'd up and leave me

without a trace to lead me

and now you are standing here

without looking in your eyes
        that look

that looks that makes me hope us just believe your lies
the look                      i'll

you're lost you're found your heart's been down
                         you're hard to pin down

and never know if you come through
i                 you'll

then you appear together we are here

and that's all that matters somehow

thought i could pull you from the shadows
       that

maybe help you find your wings and fly

but your path is longer than a travel
    you'are a longer

the more i'm just feeling the path mistakes from pities
the i'm just defeated  my past mistakes repeated

i risked it once again to have you near my side
i'll risk

another chance to let you just destroy my bright
                                          pride

you're lost you're your heart's been down

never know if you come through

then you appear together we are here

and that's all that matters somehow

if you like a morning now open a chain
i feel like i'm running out of energy

you just think everything is strength
while you just take everything in stride

the way i feel

to you who is no big deal
       it's

it's sad buts it's true

that one thing i can count on

is that i can't count on you
