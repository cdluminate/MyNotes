1. Legends, stories scattered through time. Mankind has grown quite fond for
   counting the exploits of heroes and villains, forgetting so easyly that
   we are remnants, byproducts of a forgotten past. Man born from dust was
   strong, wise, and resourceful, but he was born into an unforgiving world.
   An inevitable darkness, creatures of destruction, the creatures of Grim,
   set their sights on man and all of his creations. The forces clashed,
   and it seemed that the darkness was intent on returning man's brief
   existence to the void. However, even the smallest spark of hope, is enough
   to ignite change. And in time, man's passion, resourcefulness, and
   ingenuity led them to the tools that would help even the odds. This power
   was appropriately named: Dust. Nature's wrath in hand, man lit their way
   through the darkness, and in the shadows's absence came strength,
   civilization, and most importantly, life. But even the most brilliant
   lights eventually flicker and die, and when they are gone, darkness will
   return. So you may prepare your guardians, build your monuments to a
   so-called "free world". But take heed, there will be no victory in strength.
   But perhaps victory is in the simpler things that you have long forgotten,
   thing that require smaller, more honest soul. (RWBY S01E01)
