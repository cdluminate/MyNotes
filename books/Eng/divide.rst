does it feel good knowing you tried

knowing that all us remains

is it slow cold crule or dead
   the          brutal death

??? thing
of the fools that will all die in vain

how does it feel

knowing your ever prevail
             effort will fail

all that you given will be torn down 
            've built

and hope out people be sailed
the hope of your people assailed

send your guardians say we will
                    they will fail

legends and heros will crumble and fall

you will then prevail
you will not prevail

we never threading
when allied together a threat mean display

to find when will wash away
divide them with doubt it will all wash away

once more can you send me home 
one spark can incite their hope

maybe
and ignite the hearts of their weary souls

i will distinguish that
       extinguish that flame

arm your armies dream your dreams
form

think your plans and plot your sneeze
make                           schemes

turn your fighers run and all
send              one and all

then in battle watch them fall

---

it was you who entered the light
               ended their lives

pay them to dig their graves
made                 ^own

with you dark, sink, crown sign
               sick, crule design

they miss wants you saved
convinced them their world could be saved

have you know shame
         no

signing them upon your war
             up for

train them to fight when they can't be
                    what            beat

your sins wont be paid for
          are what they'll pay for

sacrifice for your need
         ^them     needs

slaughter is coming

the enter the near your
    end drawing near

with back your deed
you'll regret your deeds

---

ferry
legends and fairy tales scattered in time

lie
maidens and kindoms wrapped up in a lie

the children you mislead
these

you won't 
you'll watch them all bleed

make them bring the victory
strength will not bring victory

divide them

tear them apart

feather the trust the stren will be harod
sever their trust, it will strangle their hearts

divide them
inside them

plays him to death
plant seeds of doubt

we'll be smothered and turn on each other
hope will be smothered they'll turn on each other

hatres will sprout suspecion and doubt
hatred             syspicion

friendships die while religion's down
            deny while allegiances die

their takes will free when you get what you wanted
the taste will be sweet when you get what you've earned

and i will watch you burn
