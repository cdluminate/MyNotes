Officials in China use strong-arm tactics to curb burials. To make their point,
they seize coffins and smash them.

But after a few months ago officials entered the home of the 81-year-old and
took the casket away. She says the 1,000 yuan they gave her in compensation was
one-half to one-third of its value.

The distress of Ms Wang is shared by neighbours in her village bordered by
bright-green rice fields in Shangrao, a prefecture in the south-eastern
province of Jiangxi.

State media said that villagers had willingly handed over their coffins. Locals
dispute this. "People are outraged," says one.

Efforts by the Chinese government to dissuade people from burying the dead have
a long history.

Mao's successors inherited his misgivings about burial. They had another fear,
too: that the practice could result in arable land becoming even more scarce
and thus impair China's ability to feed its rapidly growing population. The
one-child-per-couple policy, introduced in 1979, aimed to reduce the burden of
sustaining so many people by curbing the number entering the world. Anti-burial
measures, though less nationally co-ordinated, were inteneded to prevent those
dparting this world from hogging badly needed land.

Videos on social media showed old people lying in their coffins to stop
officials from seizing the caskets.

The intensified campain involves more than the usual worries about the scarcity
of farmland. The government believes that lavish spending on coffins and
mourning rituals, in order to show off the popularity or status of the
deceased, is frustrating its effort to eradicated rural poverty by 2020.
